= eBay OAuth C# Client Library
:toc:
:toclevels: 4

== Summary
To make integrations with eBay RESTful APIs easier, eBay provides client libraries in C# and Java to make it simpler to set up authorization, reduce the amount of code the application developers have to write to get OAuth Access Tokens.
This library in addition to functioning as a simple eBay OAuth Client, helps with additional features such as cached App tokens.

== What is OAuth 2.0
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749[OAuth 2.0] is the industry-standard protocol for authorization to obtain limited access to an HTTP service. All https://developer.ebay.com/docs[eBay RESTful APIs] use the OAuth 2.0 protocol for authorization.
OAuth access tokens verify to eBay that a request is coming from a valid client and that the application has the user's authorization to carry out the requests. Learn more about the https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-tokens.html[OAuth Access Tokens].

== Supported Languages
eBay OAuth Client is a class library that targets the .NET Standard 2.0. This library can be used by any .NET implementation that supports 2.0 version of the .NET Standard.

[source,xml]
Install-Package eBay.OAuth.Client -Version 1.0.0

- After the command completes, open the *.csproj* file to see the added reference:
[source, xml]
<ItemGroup>
   <PackageReference Include="eBay.OAuth.Client" Version="1.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>

=== .NET CLI
- Use the following command in your project directory, to install the *eBay.OAuth.Client* package:
[source,xml]
dotnet add package eBay.OAuth.Client --version 1.0.0

- After the command completes, open the *.csproj* file to see the added reference:

== Build eBay.OAuth.Client DLL from Source

- After cloning the project, you can build the package from the source by executing following script from project directory:
[source,shell]
./build.sh

- **ebay-oauth-csharp-client.dll** will be created at ebay-oauth-csharp-client/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0

== Use the eBay.OAuth.Client in the .NET App
- Create a config http://yaml.org/[YAML] file in your application. The config file should contain your eBay applications keys:
App Id, Cert Id & Dev Id. A sample config file is available at https://github.com/ebay/ebay-oauth-csharp-client/blob/master/Tests/ebay-config-sample.yaml[https://github.com/ebay/ebay-oauth-csharp-client/blob/master/Tests/ebay-config-sample.yaml]. Learn more about https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/creating-edp-account.html#Register[creating application keys].
[source, csharp]
name: ebay-config
api.sandbox.ebay.com:
    appid: <appid-from-developer-portal>
    certid: <certid-from-developer-portal>
    devid: <devid-from-developer-portal>
    redirecturi: <redirect_uri-from-developer-portal>
Api.ebay.com:
    appid: <appid-from-developer-portal>
    certid: <certid-from-developer-portal>
    devid: <devid-from-developer-portal>
    redirecturi: <redirect_uri-from-developer-portal>

- Once the config file is ready, use following code to load it. It is recommended to load the credentials during startup time (initialization) to prevent runtime delays.
[source,csharp]
CredentialUtil.Load(“YAML config file path”);
or
CredentialUtil.Load(System.IO.StreamReader);

- If needed, you can add an IWebProxy.
[source,csharp]
IWebProxy webProxy = new WebProxy();
//Your configuration here
ProxyUtil.WebProxy = webProxy;

- Once the credentials are loaded, call any operation on **OAuth2Api**.
1. **GetApplicationToken**: Use this operation when the application request an access token to access their own resources,
not on behalf of a user. Learn more about https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-client-credentials-grant.html[Client Credentials grant flow].
[source,csharp]
OAuth2Api.GetApplicationToken(OAuthEnvironment environment, IList<String> scopes)

2. **GenerateUserAuthorizationUrl**: Use this operation to get the Authorization URL to redirect the user to. Once the user
authenticates and approves the consent, the callback needs to be captured by the redirect URL setup by the app.
[source,csharp]
OAuth2Api.GenerateUserAuthorizationUrl(OAuthEnvironment environment, IList<String> scopes, String state)

3. **ExchangeCodeForAccessToken**: Use this operation when an application exchanges an authorization code for an access
  token. After the user authenticates, approves the consent and returns to the application via the redirect URL , the
  application will get the authorization code from the URL and use it to request an access token. Learn more about
  https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-authorization-code-grant.html[Authorization Code grant flow].
[source,csharp]
OAuth2Api.ExchangeCodeForAccessToken(OAuthEnvironment environment, String code)

4. **GetAccessToken**: Usually access tokens are short lived. Use this operation to update the access token. Learn more about https://developer.ebay.com/api-docs/static/oauth-qref-auth-code-grant.html[Using a refresh token to update the access token].
[source, csharp]
OAuth2Api.GetAccessToken(OAuthEnvironment environment, String refreshToken, IList<String> scopes)
